Don't modify the files in this directory unless you want to do some serious tweaking(kudos to you if you're doing that).
The bot treats these files as a backup, and requires these files to be formatted **just** right.
Instead, modify the files in the main directory; it'll be less painful when you mess something up(~~you will mess something up~~).
