This is a simple modular admin I wrote for Discordia
It's nothing special, but some people might find it useful

No comments because I'm lazy(tm)
Feel free to use it wherever you want.

If you somehow need help with this thing, send me a discord message: TheFlamingBlaster#6629

If you want to run this, do "[luvit-path] flame-modular.lua"
You'll need luvit and Discordia to use this.
You can get luvit and discordia here:
Luvit: https://github.com/luvit/luvit.io
Discordia: https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia

What you need to do to get this to work is fairly obvious,
you'll need to:
Change the "path" in  flame-modular.lua to where the script is located,
Change "token" in flame-modular.lua to your bot's token.
